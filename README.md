# Waste-Generation

## Introduction

 This dataset is about the generation of hazardous waste per person measured in
 kilograms in various countries over different years. 
 
 Hazardous waste contains materials that can harm the environment or human health if not properly 
 managed.
 Hence, this data is analysed to predict future waste generation to understand and help team 
 Koru with decisions to be made on waste management strategies and environmental protection measures.
 
 For example: if a country generates an average of 5 kg of waste per person, it simply
 means that the people in that country are all responsible for the same amount of waste
 generation. Hence, these key metrics are calculated to describe the central
 tendency of the data and quantify the reliability of the estimates

## Statistical Analysis for Hazardous waste
 The results suggest that the global average waste per person is 1.4741550534441913e-17.
 This tells people they are generating a very small amount of waste.
 
 However, there is some uncertainty in our estimate, and with a 95% confidence interval
 shows that the true average waste per person falls within the range of approximately:
 -0.0632 to 0.0632.
 
 The confidence level associated with the confidence interval is 95%. This means that if
 we were to repeat the sampling process many times, about 95% of the time, the true
 average waste per person would fall within the calculated range
