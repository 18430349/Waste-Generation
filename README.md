# Waste-Generation

##Introduction
 This dataset is about the generation of hazardous waste per person measured in
 kilograms in various countries over different years. 
 
 Hazardous waste contains materials that can harm the environment or human health if not properly 
 managed.
 Hence, this data is analysed to predict future waste generation to understand and help team 
 Koru with decisions to be made on waste management strategies and environmental protection measures.
 
 For example: if a country generates an average of 5 kg of waste per person, it simply
 means that the people in that country are all responsible for the same amount of waste
 generation. Hence, these key metrics are calculated to describe the central
 tendency of the data and quantify the reliability of the estimates
